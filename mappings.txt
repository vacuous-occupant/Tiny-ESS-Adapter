This gets you pretty close to original N64 controller feeling. Not good for wobbly thumbsticks.
0, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 27, 28, 29, 30, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 34, 35, 36, 36, 37, 38, 38, 39, 40, 40, 41, 42, 42, 43, 44, 44, 45, 45, 46, 47, 47, 48, 48, 49, 49, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 54, 55, 55, 56, 56, 56, 57, 57, 58, 58, 59, 59, 59, 60, 60, 61, 61, 61, 62, 62, 63, 63, 63, 64, 64, 64, 64, 65, 65, 65, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 67, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71

Wobbly thumbstick map
This worked on my 10+ year old controller. ESS zone is notably larger than N64.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 27, 27, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31, 31, 32, 32, 33, 33, 34, 34, 35, 35, 36, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 54, 55, 55, 55, 56, 56, 56, 57, 57, 57, 58, 58, 58, 58, 58, 59, 59, 59, 60, 60, 61, 61, 62, 62, 63, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70

No dead zone map
Large ESS zone, no dead zone. I like this one for Y axis.
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 26, 27, 27, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31, 31, 32, 32, 32, 33, 33, 33, 34, 34, 34, 35, 35, 35, 36, 36, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 54, 55, 55, 55, 56, 56, 56, 57, 57, 57, 58, 58, 58, 58, 58, 59, 59, 59, 60, 60, 61, 61, 62, 62, 63, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70

Slight dead zone map
Large ESS zone, small dead zone. I like this one for X axis.
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 26, 27, 27, 28, 28, 29, 29, 30, 30, 31, 31, 32, 32, 32, 33, 33, 33, 34, 34, 34, 35, 35, 35, 36, 36, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50, 51, 51, 52, 52, 53, 53, 54, 54, 55, 55, 55, 56, 56, 56, 57, 57, 57, 58, 58, 58, 58, 58, 59, 59, 59, 60, 60, 61, 61, 62, 62, 63, 63, 64, 64, 65, 65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 68, 68, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70
